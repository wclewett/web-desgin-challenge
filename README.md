The purpose of the Weather Visualization project was to analyze how your position on Earth affected the temperature you experience. We gathered our data on 550 cities using the OpenWeatherMap API. Visit [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) to learn more about how their API works. [Click here to visit the deployed site!](https://wclewett.github.io/web-design-challenge/landing.html)
